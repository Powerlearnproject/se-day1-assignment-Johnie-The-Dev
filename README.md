Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
1. Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development of high quality and reliable software. It involves designing, developing, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
2. Software engineering is important as it enables us to solve real-life problems using high quality and dependable softare. For instance it helps improve communication through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram that enable fast secure communications 24/7


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages - The development of programming languages made it easier for programmers to write computer programs in a language the programmers would understand as opposed to the manaual coding of programs using punch
cards. This made writing programs quick and efficient.
2. The establishment of Sofware Enginneering as a discipline in the 1960s - This enabled a dedicated research of software enginneering principles which led to development of better programming languages and highly efficient methods of writting software programs.
3. The development of agile development methodologies in the 2000s - This led to sofware development teams using quick methods that allowed for fast prototyping and also the including of software users in the development process to streamline the developent process as well as enhancing flexibilty incase the requirements changed.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements gathering - This involves the gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements
2. Design - This involves creating highly detailed designs of software architecture and the user interface
3. Implementation - This is where the designs are transformed into actual software products through coding
4. Testing - This is checking the software to see where it functions properly and satisfies user requirements
5. Deployment - This is where the software product is releasd to the users or customers for use
6. Maintenance - This is the constant checking of the software for bugs and improvements  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall methodology - This is the step by step development of a software product in a sequential manner with each step having its own appointed time and budget. It is mainly used in projects where requirements are fixed and unlikely to change or where changes would be costly eg. hardware dependent solutions or large scale enterprise software where upfront planning is crucial
2. Agile methodology - This is the development of software in quick flexible iterations. Work is divided into quick incremental cycles called sprints(1-4 weeks) and customer involvement is highly encouraged. It is mainly used in startups and software products that need quick iterations, web and mobile app development where requirements evolve based on user feedback, projects with uncertain and evolving requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - Involved in writting software products based on the software design and requirements. They are also involved in fixing software bugs
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Makes sure the software product is of high quality and that it satisfies user/market requirements
3. Project Manager - Ensures that the software product is developed on time and on budget making sure each phase is carried out efficiently and coordinates among the different members involved


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) are important as they provide all the tools that a programmer needs such as a code editor, debbuging tools and extensions and plug-ins all in one place. They include Visual Studio, Eclipse and Pycharm.
2. Version Control Systems(VCS) are important in as they allow the programmer or development teams to keep track of changes in software and safely write new versions of software without affecting the production software enabling easy upgrade or rollbacks. They include Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Scope creep - this is where the features included in a software are beyond the requirements or irrelevant. This can be addressed by adequate requirements gathering and analysis
2. Time management - this is where a developer wastes time by concentrating on one feature for a long time at the expense of others or staying in one phase for long. This can be addressed by having a project management software such as Jira or Trello
3. Burn-out - this is where a developer feels exhausted by spending too much time on development at the expense of their social life and other activities. This can be solved or managed by having clear boundaries between work and personal time and having a well fixed and balanced work schedule


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing is the testing of individual software components to see whether they work according to their functionality. 
2. Integration testing is the testing of different software components to see how they work in relation to each other. This checks to see whether each functionality works as intended and that data can flow efficiently in the software product
3. System testing is the testing of the whole software product to see whether it fulfills requirements and that all components are functional.
4. Acceptance testing is checking to see whether the user or customer is satisfied by the product. This allows the developers to know that the software is of good quality and that it is relevant in the market.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
1. Prompt engineering is the writting of clear, concise and detailed prompts. This enables us to get accurate output from the models. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. Climate change(vague)
2. Explain what climate change is, its causes and effects to our lives(improved)
3. The improved prompt is more effective in as it allows the model to undertand exactly what about climate change we want to know
